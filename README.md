# Pluvia Goldberg Fork

**Disclaimer: This software is intended for playing games that you legally own. Do not use this software for piracy or any other illegal purposes. The maintainer of this fork assumes no responsibility for misuse or for any action taken against your Steam account (e.g., account blocking) as a result of using this software.**

This is a fork of the Pluvia Steam emulator for Android. This version specifically utilizes Goldberg Emulator's `steam_api.dll` and `steam_api64.dll` to potentially bypass certain DRM checks, enabling offline play for some games.

## Features

Pluvia is still in active early development, so some features may be lacking or not working correctly.</br>
Pluvia currently provides these features:

- View and download games through the app.
- Play games using [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator) built into the app. (Compatibility with some DRM-protected games is improved via Goldberg Emulator integration).
- Configure the game containers to use different options to improve the performance of each game.
- Steam Cloud integration for your cloud saves, allowing you to resume where you left off.
- View your friends list. (Note: chat and friend management in the works too)

&ast; Existing issues or limitations that occur with the actual Winlator app will mostly apply here when running a game.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/wiki) for more information.


See the [compatibility repo](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNativeCompat) to check if your game runs.
